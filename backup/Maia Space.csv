After recalling latest major milestones at operational, commercial and Team levels of our 3-year-old company, Raphaél emphasized the unique win-win  relationships MaiaSpace’s engineers have been building with industrial partners, based ona co-engineering approach, constantly sharing feedback on specifications to reach the ambitious cost targets for a mini launcher to be competitive in terms of cost per kilogram versus heavy launch solutions.

Maia Space,"+ MaiaSpace + Follow Se 22840 loners 3mo+@  Cutting costs by a factor of 3  During the European Space Conference (Brussels), MaiaSpace CEO Yohann Leroy highlighted the necessity to reduce costs by at least a factor of 3 compared to traditional methods, in order to counterbalance scale effects unfavourable to micro- mini launchers and to align with heavy launchers in terms of price per kilo deployed in Space.  Other key conditions to be competitive on the global market are:  ‘Speed: Thanks to disruptive development methods combined with the existing expertise developed in the European space sector over 4 decades, MaiaSpace takes up the challenge to develop its reusable launcher in 4 years, with a first fight in 2026 from Kourou (French Guiana), to accelerate market entry and return on investments.  Scalability: With 2 launchers (reusable and expendable) for the development costs of 1 and the Colibri kick-stage added as an option, MaiaSpace addresses a larger satellites market segment compared to other projects of this category:  Evolutivity: MaiaSpace leverages technologies (.e. high and variable-thrust engine, technological bricks enabling the vertical recovery of the first stage on a barge at sea) that can be implemented on heavier launch vehicles for a fraction of the costs necessary to develop new rockets;  ‘Sustainability: Integrating from Day 1 technologies that minimize the environmental impact of space activities (ie. LOx/Bio-sourced Methane, reusability, in-orbit servicing) will become a competitive advantage.

Top 3 reasons are as follows  © Liquid methane as a fuel is a good comprise between extreme performance (reached by the super cold liquid hydrogen) and robustness (usually associated to kerosene), while balancing both parameters is key for a reusable rocket;  & Denser and less tricky to handle than hydrogen, methane allows to design more ‘compact and much simpler tanks, reducing the volume and weight of a the main stage, which is of importance when dealing with recovery of a rocket stage at sea:  © When produced locally, i. from mainly organic waste and crops, bio-methane is one of the rocket propellant with the lowest environmental impacts.

During the panel ‘Lifecycle Sustainability’, our environmental performance expert Antoinette Ott explained how Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of our launcher is performed since day one, as we are continously working on tackling the unique challenges the space sector faces for assessing its environmental impact. We are working with academic partners and participating to standardization efforts to help tackle these gaps.  From improving propellant production efficiency to maximizing performance/dry mass and filling ratio of our launchers through modularity, or paving the way for in-orbit, mobility services, our ultimate objective is to mitigate our impact on both Earth and space environments, as we believe this is a social responsibility and a potential competitive advantage for the future.  #Reusability #Innovation #Maia  Panel Session Theme i Commercial Sp: Moderator: Thilo Kranz, anager, ESA Panel Members: Governmer  1, Alan Thompson, Heat  eee = ee renee,",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maiaspace_reusability-innovation-maia-activity-7260206805278932992-yc_3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFszMIoBPo6W4ZcByLQJfMIqPrftEWnjAbU

Maia Space,"é + MaiaSpace  During his participation at the Paris Air Forum, CEO discussed the mini-launcher market alongside | Chief Commercial Officer at . |, Chief Business  Development Officer at and , Director of Space  Transportation at  This discussion allowed us to outline the competitive landscape of the mini-launcher market and to highlight the benefits reusability brings in the economics of a mini launcher developed with private money, namely competitive access to a wider market. This wider access leads to higher cadence, hence easier amortization of non-recurring costs, faster recurring costs reduction, more launch opportunities, and better resilience.  To be successful, we need also to go fast, foster a more offensive risk culture, accepting failures as opportunities to learn, accelerate, and ultimately reduce costs. This is what MaiaSpace does, bringing together the best of both worlds: the expertise of the European space sector, and the agility, speed and risk-taking culture of a start-up.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maiaspace_parisairforum-maiaspace-space-activity-7207377942715191296-np11?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFszMIoBPo6W4ZcByLQJfMIqPrftEWnjAbU
