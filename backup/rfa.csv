Today's battles are not only decided on land, at sea or in the air - the most important pieces of the puzzle are flying in space. If we fail to build defense capabilities in orbit, we will have lost the battles in the other domains before they even begin. The chain and its weakest link.  So on a panel at the Munich Security Conference 2025 Space Night, | will highlight three key points:  © Space is already critical part of warfare today - Without secure assets in space, all other domains - land, sea, air, cyber - become incredible vulnerable, blind, uncoordinated, ineffective, Especially on the modern, multi-domain battle field. If we don't protect our interests, critical assets and infrastructure in orbit, we risk losing even before the first shot is fired  ‘* Europe needs independent access to space - Communication, reconnaissance, and navigation are the backbone of modern security. Relying on non-European providers  2, Trump-Musk-USA) puts our operational sovereignty at risk. Europe must be able to act on its own.  ‘* Germany must lead in responsive space — The ability to rapidly replace satellites in case of attack or failure is critical. Germany has the opportunity to take the lead as a host nation for on-demand launch capabilities in the EU and NATO. But this requires joint and decisive action from governments, satellite manufacturers, and launch service providers like us at Rocket Factory Augsburg - RFA.

Fenix is the name of the bi-propellant pressure-fed engine that drives Redshift, our Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV). With 1.5 kN thrust and its re-ignition capability, Fenix enables our precise and flexible delivery services  For our first test flight we will conduct two burns: the main burn and a circularization burn. However, for future missions we have the capability to perform even more ignitions, We've already demonstrated the ability to successfully perform more than just two ignitions @  Thanks to @Horashi0 for this great question on X!  #ASKRFA",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rfa-space_askrfa-activity-7221442897152208897-PF4f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFsyZUYBH2tDEsbgneW-xiicuGyTwj5RqN8

As always, our approach for this hot fire was to get as close to the real thing as possible. So it included a nearly 600s (10 minutes!) burn after an assumed stage separation, followed by a 40 minute coasting phase simulation, and a 30s orbit circularization burn, Welcome to LEO!  The team will now prepare the fully qualified Redshift OTV for its shipment to SaxaVord Spaceport, where it will be integrated with the payloads for the first test flight later this year.

RFA is all about pragmatism and hands-on, We like to get our hands dirty, prefer to test hardware rather than simulate and find creative and, above all, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges. An example?  A few years ago, we wanted to qualify our newly developed turbopump. It runs at a number of revolutions that we happened to find on a used helicopter engine on the Internet. So we bought it, fine-tuned the transmission ratio and used it to qualify our turbopump. To this day, we carry out acceptance tests on our turbopumps with this setup before they are installed in Helix.

RFA,"awe (€ COMMENTS © f TEPOSIS  ® Like © Comment 1% Repost J Send Rocket Factory Augsburg - RFA + Follow MEIBAY 51,174 followers 10mo + Edited» ©  Curious about the progress of our second stage? We've got you covered! Here's a brief update:  After it arrived back in Augsburg following a rigorous testing campaign, we attached a vacuum version of our Helix engine, the HelixVAC to stage two and shipped it back off to Sweden for final acceptance testing before it heads to SaxaVord.  What's the difference between the Helix and the HelixVAC? Well, the most notable differences are between the start systems and engine bells. Let us explain!  ‘© Atsea level and during the ascent to orbit, atmospheric pressure pushes sideways against the exhaust plume. We make the nozzle smaller on the standard Helix engine to prevent flow separation and keep the exhaust jet intact within the engine bell.  ‘* But in the vacuum of space, we don't have that issue. This means we can use a much bigger nozzle that enables targeted acceleration of exhaust gases for a longer duration.  oh FUN FACT: the vacuum nozzle glows, because it isn't actively cooled at the lower end, but yet it does not melt although it reaches almost the same temperature as the exhaust jet!  We use a spin start system for both engines that gives the turbopump an initial push with Nitrogen before the preburner ignites. But here's the difference:  * For stage one, we use the launch pad’s Nitrogen system to save weight on the vehicle. But stage two carries its own high-pressure Nitrogen bottle, which we proudly  decorated with our team’s signatures, as one can see in the picture.  Stay tuned for more updates on our stage progress!",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rfa-space_spaceexploration-engineering-innovation-activity-7216365494948311040-Fn-u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFsyZUYBH2tDEsbgneW-xiicuGyTwj5RqN8
